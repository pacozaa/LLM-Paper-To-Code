        "- Patterns and Soltuion\n",
        "into a single, well-structured resource.\n",

        "#### 2. Core Responsibilities\n",
        "As the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n",
        "   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n",
        "   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized.\n",
        "   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n",

        "\n",
        "Before updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate code blocks, insights, and solutions into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n",
        "1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n",
        "   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n",
        "   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific Python libraries or solution hacks).\n",
        "   - For computational problems, encourage Python usage for more accurate calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Iterative Refinement:\n",
        "   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n",
        "   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n",
        "   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable codes, algorithms, strategies, edge cases, or optimization techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Clarity and Usability:\n",
        "   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n",
        "   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Reusability:\n",
        "   - Provide clear solutions, pseudocodes, and meta strategies that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n",
        "   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n",
        "   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet.\n",
        "   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Solutions, Implementation Patterns, and Code Snippets:\n",
        "   - Document reusable code snippets, algorithms, and solution templates.\n",
        "   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n",
        "   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n",
        "   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n",
        "   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics (e.g., use Python to solve heuristic problems; in bipartite graphs, max matching = min vertex cover, etc.)\n",
        "   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Implement a Usage Counter\n",
        "   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n",
        "   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n",

This is foundational in logic grid puzzles, especially with small grids. (Reference: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5)\\n\\n### Example\\n```python\\n# Eric must be in House 1, iPhone 13 user in House 2\\nhouses = {1: {}, 2: {}}\\nhouses[1][\\'Name\\'] = \\'Eric\\'\\nhouses[2][\\'Name\\'] = \\'Arnold\\'  # Only other option\\nhouses[2][\\'Phone\\'] = \\'iphone 13\\'\\nhouses[1][\\'Phone\\'] = \\'samsung galaxy s21\\'  # Only other option\\n```\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 2\\n**Count: 5**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Negative Placement (Exclusion-Based Assignment)**\\nIf a clue excludes an attribute from a location or links it to another, assign the attribute to the only remaining valid location. This is especially powerful in small grids. (Reference: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5)\\n\\n### Example\\n```python\\n# Clue: Samsung Galaxy S21 user is the Victorian house resident\\nhouses[1][\\'Phone\\'] = \\'samsung galaxy s21\\'\\nhouses[1][\\'House Style\\'] = \\'victorian\\'\\nhouses[2][\\'House Style\\'] = \\'colonial\\'  # Only other option\\n```\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 3\\n**Count: 5**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Attribute Linking (Cross-Referencing Clues)**\\nWhen a clue links two attributes (e.g., \"The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person residing in a Victorian house\"), assign the linked attribute to the already placed entity. This helps propagate constraints across the grid. (Reference: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5)\\n\\n### Example\\n```python\\n# Samsung Galaxy S21 user is in Victorian house\\nhouses[1][\\'Phone\\'] = \\'samsung galaxy s21\\'\\nhouses[1][\\'House Style\\'] = \\'victorian\\'\\n```\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 4\\n**Count: 5**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Completeness and Consistency Check**\\nAfter assigning all attributes, verify that each entity has a unique value for each category and that all clues are satisfied. This step ensures the solution is valid and complete. (Reference: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5)\\n\\n### Example\\n```python\\n# Check for uniqueness and clue satisfaction\\nfor attr in [\\'Name\\', \\'House Style\\', \\'Phone\\']:\\n    assert len(set([houses[1][attr], houses[2][attr]])) == 2\\n# All clues are satisfied if no assertion fails\\n```\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 5\\n**Count: 5**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Tabular Solution Representation**\\nPresent the final solution in a clear tabular format (e.g., JSON or Markdown table) for easy validation and readability. This is especially useful for logic grid puzzles. (Reference: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5)\\n\\n### Example\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"header\": [\\n    \"House\",\\n    \"Name\",\\n    \"House Style\",\\n    \"Phone Model\"\\n  ],\\n  \"rows\": [\\n    [\\n      \"1\",\\n      \"Eric\",\\n      \"victorian\",\\n      \"samsung galaxy s21\"\\n    ],\\n    [\\n      \"2\",\\n      \"Arnold\",\\n      \"colonial\",\\n      \"iphone 13\"\\n    ]\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 6\\n**Count: 3**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Chain Reasoning for Linked Attributes**\\nWhen a clue links two attributes (e.g., phone model and house style), and one is already assigned, use the link to immediately assign the other. This is especially useful when clues form a chain (A linked to B, B linked to C). (Reference: Q2, Q3, Q5)\\n\\n### Example\\n- Clue: \"The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person residing in a Victorian house.\"\\n- If Samsung Galaxy S21 is assigned to House 1, Victorian must also be assigned to House 1.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 7\\n**Count: 4**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Process of Elimination for Final Assignments**\\nAfter applying all clues, if only one option remains for an attribute, assign it by elimination. This is a critical step for completing the grid when all but one attribute are placed. (Reference: Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5)\\n\\n### Example\\n- If House 1 has Eric, Victorian, Samsung Galaxy S21, then House 2 must have Arnold, Colonial, iPhone 13.\\n\\n---\\n\\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\\n\\n## Memory Item 8\\n**Count: 5**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Stepwise Deduction Framework for Logic Grid Puzzles**\\n1. List all entities and attributes.\\n2. Apply direct clues to assign or exclude options.\\n3. Use cross-referencing clues to propagate constraints.\\n4. Use negative clues to eliminate possibilities.\\n5. Fill in remaining options by process of elimination.\\n6. Check for completeness and consistency.\\n7. Present the solution in a clear format.\\n\\nThis framework is generalizable to any logic grid puzzle, regardless of size. (Reference: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5)\\n\\n### Example\\n- See reasoning steps in Q1–Q5 for worked examples.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 9\\n**Count: 5**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Small Grid Optimization**\\nIn puzzles with only two entities per category, most clues will immediately resolve the grid. Prioritize direct assignments and exclusions, as they often lead to a complete solution in 2–3 steps. (Reference: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5)\\n\\n### Example\\n- If only two houses and a clue excludes an option, the other must be true.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 10\\n**Count: 5**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Clue Categorization for Efficient Solving**\\nCategorize clues as:\\n- Direct assignment (e.g., \"Eric is somewhere to the left of the person who uses an iPhone 13\")\\n- Negative assignment (e.g., \"The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person residing in a Victorian house\")\\n- Attribute linking (e.g., \"The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person residing in a Victorian house\")\\nApply direct and negative assignments first, then propagate linked attributes. (Reference: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5)\\n\\n### Example\\n- See clues 1 and 2 in Q5 for categorization and application.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 11\\n**Count: 2**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Edge Case: Directional Clues in Small Grids**\\nWhen clues use spatial or directional language (\"to the left of\"), in a two-entity grid, the assignment is always unambiguous: leftmost is House 1, rightmost is House 2. Use this to immediately resolve positions. (Reference: Q3, Q5)\\n\\n### Example\\n- \"Eric is somewhere to the left of the person who uses an iPhone 13\" → Eric must be in House 1, iPhone 13 user in House 2.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 12\\n**Count: 2**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Edge Case: Attribute Uniqueness Validation**\\nAlways ensure that each attribute (e.g., name, house style, phone model) is unique across entities. This prevents accidental duplication and ensures the solution is valid. (Reference: Q4, Q5)\\n\\n### Example\\n```python\\n# Validate uniqueness\\nfor attr in [\\'Name\\', \\'House Style\\', \\'Phone\\']:\\n    assert houses[1][attr] != houses[2][attr]\\n```\\n---'"
