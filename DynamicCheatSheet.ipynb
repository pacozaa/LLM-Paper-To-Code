        "As the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks, including algorithmic challenges, debugging, creative writing, and more. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges.\n",
        "- After seeing each input, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Core Responsibilities\n",
        "As the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n",
        "   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n",
        "   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized.\n",
        "   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n",
        "   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as efficient code snippets and actionable guidelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate code blocks, insights, and solutions into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n",
        "1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n",
        "   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n",
        "   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific Python libraries or solution hacks).\n",
        "   - For computational problems, encourage Python usage for more accurate calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Iterative Refinement:\n",
        "   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n",
        "   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n",
        "   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable codes, algorithms, strategies, edge cases, or optimization techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Clarity and Usability:\n",
        "   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n",
        "   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Reusability:\n",
        "   - Provide clear solutions, pseudocodes, and meta strategies that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n",
        "   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n",
        "   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet.\n",
        "   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\n",
        "The cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Solutions, Implementation Patterns, and Code Snippets:\n",
        "   - Document reusable code snippets, algorithms, and solution templates.\n",
        "   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n",
        "   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n",
        "   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n",
        "   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics (e.g., use Python to solve heuristic problems; in bipartite graphs, max matching = min vertex cover, etc.)\n",
        "   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Implement a Usage Counter\n",
        "   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n",
        "   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

Start with direct assignments from the clues, then use constraint propagation, permutation-based search, and elimination to fill remaining slots. (Reference: Q1, Q2)\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n**Step-by-step pattern:**\\n1. Create a table with each house as a row; columns for each attribute.\\n2. Insert all direct assignments (\"X is Y\", \"X is in house N\").\\n3. Parse clues that relate categories (\"A is B is C in the same house\") and assign those together.\\n4. For clues involving order (\"A is left of B\", \"X is directly to the left of Y\"), use indices.\\n5. For clues like \"N houses between\", calculate allowed pairs (see Memory Item 2).\\n6. Ensure unique assignments across houses.\\n\\n**Python template:**\\n```python\\nfrom itertools import permutations\\nATTRS = {\\n    \"names\": [\"Eric\", \"Peter\", \"Alice\", \"Arnold\"],\\n    \"cars\": [\"tesla model 3\", \"honda civic\", \"toyota camry\", \"ford f150\"],\\n    \"months\": [\"jan\", \"april\", \"sept\", \"feb\"],\\n    \"hobbies\": [\"painting\", \"cooking\", \"gardening\", \"photography\"]\\n}\\n# Generate all possible assignments:\\nfor name in permutations(ATTRS[\\'names\\']):\\n    for car in permutations(ATTRS[\\'cars\\']):\\n        for month in permutations(ATTRS[\\'months\\']):\\n            for hobby in permutations(ATTRS[\\'hobbies\\']):\\n                # Fill all constraints here...\\n                pass\\n```\\n**Usage Tip:** For dense puzzles, list all possible tables, filter via clues, or leverage a constraint programming solver (e.g., python-constraint).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 2\\n**Count: 2**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Clue parsing for \"N houses between\" and positional constraints.**  \\nInterpret clues like \"1 house between A and B\" as index difference 2. For \"directly left of\", difference is 1.  \\nAlso, process clues like \"to the left\" (A is before B in order).\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n- \"X is directly left of Y\": If Y in position p, X is at p–1.\\n- \"There is one house between X and Y\": If X at p, Y at p+2 or p–2.\\n- \"X is somewhere to the left of Y\": X\\'s index must be less than Y\\'s index.\\n\\n```python\\ndef positions_with_gap(length, pos, gap):\\n    res = []\\n    if pos - (gap + 1) >= 0:\\n        res.append(pos - (gap + 1))\\n    if pos + (gap + 1) < length:\\n        res.append(pos + (gap + 1))\\n    return res\\n# Example: 4 houses, if Tesla is at 2, gardening must be at 0 or 4\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 3\\n**Count: 2**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Multi-attribute chain assignments and exclusion.**  \\nIf multiple clues link attributes (e.g., \"Arnold owns a Tesla and his birthday is in April\"), bundle and assign all at once. Remove those choices from all other houses.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nGiven:\\n- Arnold = Tesla Model 3 & April  \\nAssign [Arnold, Tesla Model 3, April] to the same house.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 4\\n**Count: 2**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Consistency check: Validate solution against all constraints.**  \\nOnce the table is filled, methodically check every clue for full compliance. If a clue fails, re-examine ambiguous clues or reassign.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n- For each clue, e.g. \"Alice is the photography enthusiast\", ensure table[house_with_alice][\\'hobby\\'] == \\'photography\\'.\\n- For clues with order, check indices.\\n\\n**Python check:**\\n```python\\ndef satisfies_all_constraints(table, clues):\\n    for clue in clues:\\n        if not clue(table):\\n            return False\\n    return True\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 5\\n**Count: 2**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Enforcing uniqueness and early pruning in assignment.**  \\nIn assignment-based puzzles, confirm that every category (name, car, month, hobby) features only once per column, eliminating impossible permutations early.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n- If Alice is assigned to House 1, exclude Alice from other rows and likewise for her car, month, and hobby.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 6\\n**Count: 2**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Python CSP and constraint solver automation for logic puzzles.**  \\nAutomate complex logic puzzles by defining constraints as functions and searching all permutations. Especially powerful for puzzles with 4+ categories.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n```python\\nfrom constraint import Problem\\nproblem = Problem()\\nhouses = [1, 2, 3, 4]\\nproblem.addVariables(houses, ATTRS[\"names\"])\\n# Define constraint functions such as \"Arnold must have Tesla Model 3 and birthday April\"\\n# problem.addConstraint(...)\\nsolution = problem.getSolutions()\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 7\\n**Count: 2**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Edge Cases in logic puzzles: ambiguous clue handling.**  \\nWhen clue wording is ambiguous (\"One house between\" vs. \"next to\" vs. \"left of\"), utilize both interpretations and select solutions with maximal clue satisfaction.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n- For \"one house between X and Y\": Typically, abs(idx_X - idx_Y) == 2.\\n- Test both forward (X before Y) and reverse order; prefer solutions best matching majority clues.\\n\\n---\\n\\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 8\\n**Count: 2**\\n\\n### Description\\n**High-level solving framework for Zebra/logic puzzles:**  \\n1. Tabular representation; assign direct clues.\\n2. Parse and link multi-attribute clues.\\n3. Track nearest-neighbor clues and order relations.\\n4. Systematically propagate assignments, always check uniqueness.\\n5. Validate each solution against every clue; if all satisfied or only ambiguous cases remain, proceed.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n- For clues like \"A is the X, X is the Y\", assign all at once. For \"A is somewhere to the left of B\", restrict indices accordingly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 9\\n**Count: 2**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Multi-layer elimination and backtracking for full clue validation.**  \\nIf a combination almost fits (e.g., one clue interpretation doesn\\'t match), use backtracking and test alternative orderings. Only accept solutions maximizing constraint satisfaction.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n- Build and test multiple tables with slight variations in ambiguous clue interpretation, validate highest-consistency table.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Memory Item 10\\n**Count: 2**\\n\\n### Description\\n**Definitive Example Table for a 4-house Zebra-type logic puzzle.**  \\nA solved example for cross-reference and testing new puzzles.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n| House | Name   | Car           | Birthday | Hobby       |\\n|-------|--------|---------------|----------|-------------|\\n| 1     | Alice  | ford f150     | sept     | photography |\\n| 2     | Eric   | honda civic   | feb      | cooking     |\\n| 3     | Arnold | tesla model 3 | april    | painting    |\\n| 4     | Peter  | toyota camry  | jan      | gardening   |\\n\\n---'"
