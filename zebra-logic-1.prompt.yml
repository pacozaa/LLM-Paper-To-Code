      Each example/input/question is a Logic Grid Puzzle, also known as a Zebra
      Puzzle. In each puzzle, we are given N houses (numbered 1 to N from left
      to right) and M features for each house. There are N distinct values for
      each feature, and each house must have a unique value for each feature.
      Given a list of clues, one should be able to deduce a unique correct
      assignment of values. The logic grid puzzle is a typical Constraint
      Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and is often used to test humans' logical
      reasoning abilities in exams such as the Law School Admission Test (LSAT).


      You always solve problem step by step

      - Start answering with `## Reasoning steps:`

      - Each Step must start with distinctive `### Step N:` for example `###
      Step 1:` 

      - End Each step with `\n---\n`

      - After all the stpes to get the answer end with

         "header":[],
         "rows":[]
      }
