      Each question is a Logic Grid Puzzle, also known as a Zebra Puzzle. In
      each puzzle, we are given N houses (numbered 1 to N from left to right)
      and M features for each house. There are N distinct values for each
      feature, and each house must have a unique value for each feature. Given a
      list of clues, one should be able to deduce a unique correct assignment of
      values. The logic grid puzzle is a typical Constraint Satisfaction Problem
      (CSP) and is often used to test humans' logical reasoning abilities in
      exams such as the Law School Admission Test (LSAT).

      ## Reasoning steps:


      Let's go through the clues systematically.


      ### Step 1: Initial information


      * 3 houses: House 1, House 2, House 3 (from left to right).

      * Names: Peter, Eric, Arnold.

      * Colors: red, white, yellow.

      * Children: Fred, Meredith, Bella.


      ### Step 2: Apply clue 3


      3. The person's favorite color is red is in the second house.


      So:  

      House 2 - Color: red


      ### Step 3: Apply clue 1


      1. Arnold is the person whose favorite color is red.


      So:  

      House 2 - Name: Arnold  

      House 2 - Color: red  


      ### Step 4: Apply clue 4


      4. The person's child is named Bella is in the first house.


      So:  

      House 1 - Children: Bella


      ### Step 5: Apply clue 5


      5. The person who loves white is the person's child is named Meredith.


      That means:  

      Whoever has white as their favorite color, his child is Meredith.


      So: If a house has Color: white, its Children: Meredith.


      Now we know:

      - House 1: Children: Bella (so can't be Meredith)

      - House 2: Color: red (so can't be white)

      Therefore, House 3 must be Color: white and Children: Meredith.


      So:  

      House 3 - Color: white  

      House 3 - Children: Meredith


      ### Step 6: Determine remaining assignments


      Now, assign all possible attributes:


      - Colors used: red (House 2), white (House 3), so House 1 must be yellow.
        - House 1 - Color: yellow

      - Children: Bella (House 1), Meredith (House 3), so House 2 must be Fred.
        - House 2 - Children: Fred

      - Names: Arnold (House 2), Peter/Eric remaining.


      ### Step 7: Apply clue 2


      2. The person's child named Fred is somewhere to the left of Eric.


      House 2 - Children: Fred  


      For Fred to be left of Eric, Eric must be in House 3. (As House 2 is
      already Fred, and must be left of Eric.)


      - House 3 - Name: Eric


      Now, House 1 is the only one left for Peter.


      ### Step 8: Fill in the grids


      - House 1: Name: Peter, Color: yellow, Children: Bella

      - House 2: Name: Arnold, Color: red, Children: Fred

      - House 3: Name: Eric, Color: white, Children: Meredith


      ## Final answer:

      ```json

      [
        {"House": "1", "Name": "Peter",  "Color": "yellow", "Children": "Bella"},
        {"House": "2", "Name": "Arnold", "Color": "red",    "Children": "Fred"},
        {"House": "3", "Name": "Eric",   "Color": "white",  "Children": "Meredith"}
      ]
